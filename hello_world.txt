I'm Wave on Discord. 
As the description states, this is my first GitHub repol with the Odin Project however, I've used GitHub and Git before after a 12 week Web and Coding training program with O.B.T (Opprotunities for a Better Tomorrow) back in 2018 so I've had some rusted experience with git in the past but experience all the same. 
Its been a while but I'm back to code and ready to push Git and GitHub to their limits!..
